        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>To know about bitcoin first we have to know about Cryptocurrency </b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for goods and services. These can be traded specifically for the good or service that the company provides.Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain.Blockchain is a decentralized technology spread across many computers that manages and records transactions. Part of the appeal of this technology is its security. The founder of cryptocurrency is Satoshi Nakamoto.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Now we have understood about Cryptocurrency, let come to our main topic, Now everyone will be thinking that what is bitcoin?</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>The answer is Bitcoin is a digital currency which operates free of any central control or the oversight of banks or governments. Instead it relies on peer-to-peer software and cryptography a public ledger records all bitcoin transactions and copies are held on servers around the world. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, later Ethereum, Litecoin, Dodgecoin etc were introduced. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 and the founder of Bitcoin is also Satoshi Nakamoto.</i></p>
    <br>    
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Now we will know about how Cryptocurrencies work but i have not studied about it in very much deep, but i will try to explain you some of the things.</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>To know about how cryptocurrency works it needs a advanced computer science and mathematics knowledge, which i don't have. Let's take the example of bitcoin, The transactions of bitcoin have public account known as ledger in digital form, This copy is strored in all the system who are the member of bitcoin network and the people who use this system are known as miners.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Now we will study about what work does a miner do?</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Miners are used for verifying the transactions. Let's take an example that there are two accounts A and B. A wants to send two bitcoins to B account , here the miner checks that account A have two bitcoins or not in his ledger. To know about if there are bitcoins in the A account they have to solve a complicated mathematics solution, this work is done on computer to solve the complicated equations, but it's not easy to solve the computer itself takes ten minutes to solve one equation because it's calculated over crores, so these miners need very complex and high and powerfull processors computers. If the equation is solved the other computers network confirm it and this transaction are added to a chain known as blockchain as a reward miners will get bitcoin, but they have to proof that they have done so much of complicated work so that they get their bitcoin.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Now we will know that how bitcoins are used?</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>Bitcoins are used as invesment and some people use it as alternate currency but invesment in bitcoin are mostly done, it's also done like store of value for example in daily life we don't use gold and we store in bank to get more money after some time like that bitcoin is also stored in banks but there is a risk in using bitcoin, people say that bitcoin is a digital currency it don't have a value itself, in simple words we can see golds physicaly but bitcoins are done on computers.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Now we will know what is the price of bitcoin?</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><i>The bitcoins were introduced in 2008 but the actual trade strated in 2009 with price of $0 , at the end of 2010 the price was $0.83, for better understanding there's a table below for the maximum touch of bitcoin per year.</i></p>
